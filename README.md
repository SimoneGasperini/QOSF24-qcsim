# qcsim: "Statevector simulation of quantum circuits"
#### [QOSF](https://qosf.org/) Mentorship Program 2024, screening task 1

To install the software directly from the source code hosted in the GitHub repository, you can do:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SimoneGasperini/QOSF24-qcsim.git
```

To test the software implementing the statevector simulator for quantum circuits, you can do:
```bash
pytest -v tests
```

> In the [notebooks](https://github.com/SimoneGasperini/QOSF24-qcsim/tree/master/notebooks) directory of the repository you can find some Jupyter notebooks showing the tests required for completing the task (e.g. simulation runtime VS number of qubits).
